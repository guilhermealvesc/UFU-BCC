# Modelagem de Software

> What is sofware engineering?

- Sofware engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production
- Software engineers should adopt a systematic and organised approach to their work and use appropriate tools and techniques depending on the problem to be solved, the development constraints and the resource available.

> What is software process?

- A set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software
- Generic activities in tall software processes are:
  - Specification - what the system should do and its development constraints
  - Development - production of the software system
  - Validation
  - Evaluation

> What is software process model?

- A simplified representation of a software process, presented from a specific perspective
- Examples of process perspectives are
  - Workflow perspective - sequence of activities
  - Data-flow perspective - information flow
  - Role/action perspective - who does what
- Generic process models
  - Waterfall
  - Iterative development
  - Component-based software engineering

> What are software engineering methods?

- Structured approaches to software development which include system models, notations, rules, design advice and process guidance
- Models descriptions (MSW)
  - Descriptions of graphical models which should be produced
- Rules (MSW)
  - Constraints applied to system models
- Recommendations (MSW)
  - Advice on good design practice
- Process guidance (ESW)
  - What activities to follow
