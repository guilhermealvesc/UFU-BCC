  @title Coin Flipping

  This is a simple and full of bugs Smart Contract to handle a coin flipping bet.
  The players are expected to choose 0 or 1. If both choose the same value, player 1 get the pot,
   otherwise player 2 wins.

  In this implementation very few checks are made: the exercise is to deliver a functional and secure smart contract.

  When verifying the honest behavior of participants you should consider:
            - If both are dishonest: the money is locked: the money gets stuck in the contract...forever!
            - If only one is honest: winner!
            - If both are honest: use the games rules do determine the winner

  There are easy fixes...but some are trick.
